# The Zen Of Refactoring or `python -c "from refactoring import this"`

## Abstract

An attempt to identify and name 19 refactoring maxims and methods, in the style and spirit of [PEP 20].

## Description

I begin with a brief historical and academic summary of the existing and current thinking around refactoring computer program.

We then look at a bunch of diffs from open source software projects and hunt for the patterns and transformations that enable us to:
- not repeat ourselves
- raise the suckiness level of the local ecosystem
- and improve the legibility and expressiveness of the problem solving code (aka features)

And then we're done.
Unless there are any questions.
