# Refactorial: Refactoring As The Quantum Of Creativity

## Introduction
![introduction](http://github.com/michaeljoseph/refactorial/raw/master/resources/introduction.png)

We are patterns, because we are matter.
We are pattern-recognition machines, because generalisation is the quantum of complexity.

Process and Pattern.
Matter and Energy.
Computation and Storage.

We grow and evolve into more complex patterns when we refactor process into pattern.
When we make something: we can turn energy into matter (m = e/c^2).
